21. A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element and the properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.
22. Since the properties of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, the properties of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour.
23. The property of inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in chemicals where reactions are not wanted.
24. The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential and preferred oxidation state.
25. The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus
26. The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space called the electron cloud.
27. A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.
28. Chemistry is sometimes called the central science because it bridges other natural sciences, including physics, geology and biology.
29. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms and how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds.
30. Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure of atoms, properties and change of matter.
